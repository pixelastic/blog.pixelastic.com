> Physics is just reverse-engineering the world

I once heard or read that somewhere and that make me smile.

Today I wondered if the same analogy could be applied to the other subjects we
are teached in school.

If Physics is reverse-engineering, then Mathematics is using the World
framework and developping new applications and unit testing with it.

Biology would be micro-debugging and desassambling it, maybe even re-compiling
it.

History would be nothing more than writing and parsing the logs.

Geography would be mapping the whole network.

French (or English, or whatever your first language is) would be reading and
learning the doc and man pages. And of course, foreign languages would mean
learning new programming languages.

Sports would be the fun part, where you are playing you video games.

Did I forgot something ?
