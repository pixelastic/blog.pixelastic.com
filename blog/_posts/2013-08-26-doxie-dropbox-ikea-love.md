Thanks to [doxie](http://getdoxie.com/) and
[dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/), I'm going the paperless way. Every
important paper I get in my physical mailbox, I now scan and put on the cloud.
I have been doing it for bills, medical papers, tickets, warranty and am now
even doing it for Ikea instruction booklets.

This way, when I'll be moving to a new appartement, I'll still be able to
dismantle and rebuild my furniture, even if they have gone out of production.

As a gift, here are the links :
