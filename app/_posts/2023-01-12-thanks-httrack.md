Sometimes, you need to download a whole website locally. And for that,
[HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/) is the best tool I ever found.

Sure, __you__ **could** use `wget` and some recursion to get what you want, but HTTrack
solves all that _for_ *you*.

Reasons you might need to download a whole website:
- You need to browse it when you don't have an internet connection (on the go,
  with low data usage, in a train, etc)
- You want to run scripts on the content, and it's faster with a local copy than
  a remote one
- You want to make a copy of a website that might disappear
