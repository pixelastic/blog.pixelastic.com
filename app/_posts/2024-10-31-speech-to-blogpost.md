As a web and software developer, I often see coding as a creative way to solve
problems. After years in the field, I take pride in writing clean,
understandable, and maintainable code. Understanding the quality of my work
gives me satisfaction, much like an artisan. Recently, I have been diving into
automation tools that help streamline repetitive tasks, enhancing my
productivity.

My journey with automation tools started with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), which
I found quite useful but limited in functionality. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
was a step up, but it’s pricey for what it offers. Then I stumbled upon
[Make](https://www.make.com/en). This platform provides many features at a lower
cost, allowing me to work faster. Even with some quirks, the speed and ease of
development I gain from Make give me a "wow effect" that would have taken years
to achieve otherwise.

Integrating tools like ChatGPT and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) has changed
how I manage information. ChatGPT, as an API, allows me to manipulate data
easily. Airtable acts as my source of truth, offering a user-friendly graphic
interface and flexible views for managing data. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
complements this by providing a smooth note-taking experience, especially with
its new API. Working with these tools is not just efficient; it feels
empowering.

I also find myself wanting to share what I learn. As a public-speaking trainer,
I hear many interesting topics and wish to help others communicate their ideas
effectively. I often think about the time I spend solving problems; sometimes
I learn concepts that, if I could explain simply, would benefit others. However,
creating an article or preparing a talk takes time I often don’t have.

To bridge this gap, I've embarked on a project to automate how I turn raw ideas
into polished content. Through voice notes, I can quickly express my thoughts,
and I want to transform these unstructured ideas into useful formats like
articles or conference talks. The thought is to create a system that organizes
and refines my notes, making it easier to share knowledge.

This process of transforming spoken ideas into written content involves
leveraging AI tools that can help refine and structure my raw notes. I imagine
a comprehensive database where I store these ideas, making the content creation
process easier and faster. The audio notes I take can serve as the seed from
which various media, such as blog posts or presentations, can grow.

In fact, this blog post is an example of what I’m trying to achieve. It all
began with a simple audio note I recorded on my phone. By analyzing and refining
that five-minute monologue, I've created something that I hope is engaging and
useful to you. This journey of integrating automation and AI into my workflow
has only begun, and I look forward to sharing more about this exploration as it
evolves.

*Disclaimer: This blog post hasn't been written by me. I recorded an audio note
of what I wanted to say, then built an automation process (using the tools
I mention) to generate the final blogpost. The ideas are mine, the way it's
written is not. It's not good enough (I feel), but is a good start.*
