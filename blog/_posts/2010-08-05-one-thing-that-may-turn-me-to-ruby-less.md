I often hear how Ruby is better than PHP, that cakePHP is only a port of the
Ruby on Rail framework and that the original is much more powerful.

Well, I've been tempted to try and learn Ruby for some quite time now. But
I've been a little scared by the fact of having to learn a whole new language
when I'm now getting pretty good with cake.

That and the shortage of hosts with a support for Ruby out there keep me away
from it.

## LESS, a Ruby only little gem

But one thing that may change my mind is [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), the CSS
as it should have been written since day one. It allows, in an extremely
simple syntax, to define variables, functions, nested definitions, easier
selectors.

Unfortunatly, the parser only exists as a Ruby gem, too bad for my php apps.

## Why I don't use the javascript version

There is [Javascript version](http://fadeyev.net/2010/06/19/lessjs-will-
obsolete-css/) of the parser, but I don't like the idea of having CSS
rendering based on script execution. It means that if I'm browsing without
scripts enabled, I won't have any styling.

Styling and Scripting are two very different things, one should work without
the other and _vice versa_

So maybe, when the syntax will be parsed directly by browsers (one could
dream...), or if a PHP parser is released I'll try it right away, but until
them, I'll stick with my rusty CSS.

## LESS in PHP ?

_Well, some hours after posting this I just stumbled upon
[that](http://leafo.net/lessphp/). I guess I'll try LESS in php world after
all !_
