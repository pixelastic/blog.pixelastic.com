<p>I recently bought an HTC Legend. My old phone was broken and I have plans to develop an Android app. I've been using the phone for 3 weeks now, and I'm not exactly as thrilled about it as I think I would.</p>
<h4>Open source from Big Brother</h4>
<p>I was hoping to have a little piece of open source software in my pocket. In fact, it turns out that Google has a little more piece of me when I'm using the phone.</p>
<p>The software is not that open. Maybe it's because of my phone carrier, SFR, but there are a lot of pre-installed and useless apps that I can't get rid of.</p>
<p>Some settings can't even be changed because I'm only a user of my own phone and don't have a root access by default. The "Accessibility" setting panel is a joke (I'll post a picture of it later)</p>
<p>When I first switched the phone on, I was asked for my Google credentials. Once entered, all my Google life was downloaded to the phone : mail address book, google maps location and google calendar meetings. Asking first if I wanted that would have been great.</p>
<p>Because loading 500+ mails address book into a phone memory is not the kind of "smart" I was expecting from a smart phone. I had to manually remove all the contacts I needed not from my phone.</p>
<p>And then the phone was complaining again, when it tried to synchronize back with Gmail, when it tried to remove the mails from my online address book.</p>
<p>I didn't want them downloaded in the first place and once I removed them I didn't want them to be deleted from my online address book !</p>
<h4>Disabling sync</h4>
<p>So I tried to remove the google account from my phone, but that is clearly impossible and is NEEDED to make the phone work. What ? This is stupid.</p>
<p>I'm not confortable with having a device from which I can't even remove my credentials... At least I disabled the auto-sync feeature.</p>
<p>An other thing to note is that if you want to fine-tune what kind of data your phone syncs, you first have to enable the auto-sync feature and quickly disable the data you don't want, because they all are checked by default.</p>
<h4>Other settings</h4>
<p>Even changing the default ringtone is a chore. There's no way to easily select a music file saved on the SD card. There isn't even a native file explorer, you have to download one from the Market.</p>
<p>The camera quality isn't very good and the auto-focus makes pictures more blurry with it than without. Even my old Nokia XpressMusic was taking better shots.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I really am disapointed by this phone actually, and by the Android platform as a whole. Maybe the underlying app is great but as an end-user we are blocked from it.</p>
<p>I'll try to root my device and remove the SFR rom to get what I want and need.</p>
