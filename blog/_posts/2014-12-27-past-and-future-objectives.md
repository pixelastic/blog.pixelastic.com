This is the end of the year, and I do realize now that I learned and did a lot
this year. I would like to write it down today, as well as what I would like to
achieve next year, and see in one year how it went.

## 2014, the year that ends

First of all, I spend the year in an [awesome company](http://www.octo.com/en)
with very talented and kind people, with immense pools of knowledge and always
ready to share it.

They taught me how to test my code, from unit testing to integration testing,
and I now can't code without writing the failing test first (TDD FTW!). And
this goes without saying all I learned about Agile methodology and conflict
resolution.

I also discovered that my areas of expertises were not where I thought they
were.  I've always considered myself a _full stack developer_ (whatever that
means), but I actually don't know that much about back-end code. Never coded
anything in Java or .NET (and don't really want to, either). But I actually
have a large experience in front-end matters (from CSS to Javascript).
I realized that good CSS skills are actually quite rare.

I went to a wide variety of tech conferences and meetups, and wrote [extended
summaries](http://meetups.pixelastic.com/). At first it was for my colleagues,
but I then made them available to everyone. Those meetups were invaluable
source of R&D. Seeing 20mn of live performance of someone convinced of what he's
talking about is worth hours of blog reading. And the discussions afterwards
made me meet some very interesting people and spawn nice discussions.

So I decided to go to the other side and became
a [speaker](http://talks.pixelastic.com/). I chose a subject I really enjoyed
and tried to make it as accessible as possible, while keeping the message
simple. I quite enjoyed it.

Writing summaries of conferences you've attended makes you rethink what you
heard and makes you remember it more. But writing your own talk really makes
you go deep in what you know and what you don't know and is an invaluable
exercise.

On a purely tech-related side, I extensively learned AngularJs and Grunt.
I also discovered Jenkins and sharpened my git skills.

I also migrated this website from a cakePHP based application on a shared
hosting to a Jekyll generated website on a private server. I now love the
clean simplicity of markdown files versionned with git, and am much more at
ease administrating my own server.

## 2015, the year to come

So, what will next year bring ? 

I'll continue attending meetups and conferences, and would like to be a speaker
more often. There are some subjects I am passionate about and could talk
about and share.

I also would like to invest myself more in the open-source world. I actually
only submit bug reports, small pull requests and use GitHub mainly as a backup
storage for some of my projects. But none get ever used by anybody else than
me. In 2015, I would like to be proud enough of one of my projects to release
it and have other people use it.

I only scratched the surface of Rails and Node this year, and never actually
pushed a full project in production. I would like to go deeper than tutorials
and TODO applications.

I would like to stop developing with AngularJS (after 1.5 years using it, I'm
still not at all convinced). React seems a very good approach to the view
rendering and I would like to test if further. Why not giving Backbone another
chance, and trying Ember.

I would like to go back to one of my first loves, CSS. I haven't touched it
enough lately and I really want to have a bit of fun with all the new
possibilities flexbox can give us.

Grunt is fine, once you know your way around, but I really need to try out Gulp
or Brunch also.

I haven't played enough with Vagrant and/or Docker for my taste. Docker is the
future and I would really like to have each of the websites hosted on my server
encapsulated in their own containers.

## Conclusion

Never stop trying, never stop learning.
