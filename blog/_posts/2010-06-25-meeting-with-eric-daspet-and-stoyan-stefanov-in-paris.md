On July 21st will be held an [informal meeting in
Paris](https://sites.google.com/a/survol.fr/webperf-user-
group/evenements/21-juillet-2010) for all the web developers that have an
interest in web performance.

[Eric Daspet](http://performance.survol.fr/) and [Stoyan
Stefanov](http://www.phpied.com/) will be there and host a talk about
performance impact on sales and some more technical less known facts.

The first part will be in French while Stoyan's will be in English. If you
have the chance to be in Paris in July, do not miss this event.

I will, of course, be there. Eric Daspet is the french "gourou" on web
performances, and Stoyan Stefanov is one of the main author of the Smushit
plugin/websit.

Web performance is a really interesting subject where there is so much to
learn and so much to try.
