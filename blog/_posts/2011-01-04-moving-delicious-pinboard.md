As you may have heard, Yahoo! is closing
[Delicious](http://www.delicious.com/). I had started to use Delicious a lot
lately, to work as a decentralised save of all my bookmarks and being able to
search through them easily.

In my recent attempt to save as much of my work online, losing Delicious would
meant losing a large part of collective wisdom. So I search for an
alternative.

I finally registered for [Pinboard ](http://pinboard.in/)a few days ago. It
allows an easy way to import Delicious bookmarks in a matter of seconds and
has all the features of Delicious I wanted.

It is not free however, but the one-time fee depends on the number of people
using the service. I payed mine 9.12$.

The website itself is not as good looking as Delicious (*ahem*), but it does
provide a cleaner search experience (in my point of view). I really don't care
about other people bookmark, I only search through mine.
