Everytime I install Ubuntu on a fresh computer and try to define custom
keybindings that use the meta (ie. Windows) key, I run into issues.

The Ubuntu UI uses the meta key to open what they call the "Dash". I never use
it and want my meta key back to define my own keybindings.

There is no way to disable it from the default Ubuntu options. You have to
install `compizconfig-settings-manager` and launch it using `ccsm`. There, go
to the Ubuntu Unity Plugin and disable the "Key to show the launcher" binding.

You will now be free to use the meta key in your keybindings, again.
