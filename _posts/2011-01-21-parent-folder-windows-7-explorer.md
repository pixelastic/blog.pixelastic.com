title: "Going to parent folder in Windows 7 Explorer"

At first I thought I missed an option somewhere, but now I have to admit :
Microsoft removes the "Go to parent folder" button in the Windows 7 version of
Explorer.

I like their new implementation of folder path, but a fast click to go up one
level, positionned in a consistent way in the UI is a plus.

After some research I found the `Alt + Up` keyboard shortcut to achieve the
same result, but while navigating through the explorer, I always am using my
mouse. Switching from mouse to keyboard is tedious, so I hunt for another
solution.

I finally installed [ClassicShell
](http://sourceforge.net/projects/classicshell/)that adds the missing button
as well as some other minor cosmetics changes.
