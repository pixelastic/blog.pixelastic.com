While trying to import a huge (1.7Go) mysql dump file into my VM I was blocked
by mysql telling me that not enough space was left on the device to complete
the operation.

As I was running a VM, I thought it would be a simple matter of increasing the
virtual hard drive size.

Turns out it wasn't that simple. After much trial and error, here is how I
finally did it.

## Creating a new hard drive

VirtualBox let you easily add new devices, such as hard drives to your VM. I
simply created an empty 120Go hard drive and booted my VM.

Here, under Ubuntu, I cloned my current hard drive to the new one using :


```sh
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb
```

## Fixing the guest partition

Once finished, I opened Gparted, selected `/dev/sdb` and saw that I had 112Go
unallocated. I couldn't easily add them to the initial partition as a swap
partition was in the way.

I finally decided to remove the swap partition and resize the initial one to
the (almost) complete size of the hard drive.

I left 1Go free in case I ever needed to create a new swap partition later to
fix the one I deleted.

Then, I closed the VM. Get back to VirtualBox panel and remove the original
drive, keeping only the new 120Go one.

One reboot later, my Ubuntu was proudly displaying its 120Go.
