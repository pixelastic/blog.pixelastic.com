Hi there,

My full name is Timothée Carry-Caignon, but I usually shorten it to Tim Carry.
It seems most people have trouble remembering and spelling the longer version
correctly. Strange isn't it ? I never had any trouble with it myself.

I've been building websites since around 1998. My main area of expertise is
front-end stuff, weaving HTML, CSS and JavaScript. PHP, Ruby and Node.js aren't
foreign languages either. I'm also a practioner of the dark arts of Linux and
vim, and I'm developing a growing interest in the DevOps side of things.

I'm living in Paris, France, and am attending many tech meetups there. There's
nothing more valuable than chatting with fellow passionate people to expand one
knowledge.

In the past, I've worked in small agencies, done some freelancing work, seen the
birth and death of a startup, took a year off in New Zealand and worked as
a consultant for [Octo Technology](http://www.octo.com/). I am currently doing
awesome and fast stuff at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)

This website is the third version of my blog, I hope you'll enjoy it.

Feel free to contact me for any comment or question by email : tim@*I'll let
you guess the domain*.  You can also follow me on

Thanks for reading !
