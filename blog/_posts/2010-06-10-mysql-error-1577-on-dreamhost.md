Recently, when connecting to my MySQL databases on Dreamhost through Navicat,
I was greeted with a "`1577 - Cannot proceed because system tables used by
Event Scheduler were found damaged at server start`" error message.

It didn't stop me from accessing the tables actually, so I didn't bother. But
today it prevent me from copying tables from one server to another, so I
decided to have a deeper look into it.

It seems that it has to do with a mysql upgrade issue. I contacted Dreamhost
about that and they told me that they just upgraded their servers to 5.1, and
that they needed to be restarted. Which they do for me.

So if you ever run into the same problem, just contact Dreamhost support and
they'll fix it for you.
