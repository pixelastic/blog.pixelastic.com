Last December I discovered that [Marvel had an API][1]. Yes, that's right,
[Marvel][2], the publisher of all the comics I used to read.  I'm a developer,
but I'm also an avid consumer of APIs and love to build things with all the
available data.

Since I joined [Algolia][3], I'm always looking for nice datasets to build demos
with, and to battle test our [instantsearch.js][4] library. While Algolia lets
you search in any kind of data (as long as you can convert it to JSON), fiddling
with a dataset full of superheroes is way funnier than any other dataset.

You can see the [full demo here][5]

So I started registering to the [Marvel developer program][6] to get an API key
and started pulling some data. Or actually that was my original plan, but the
developer website was buggy at that time and I could not register at all.

At first I was disappointed because I really wanted to index all these characters
and superpowers, but I wasn't going to let that bring me down. I started rolling
up my sleeves and went on the hunt for another interesting source of data.

## Wikipedia

I obviously quickly ended up on the [Wikipedia][7], where I could find a serie
of pages [listing all the heroes][8] and [villains][9] of the Marvel universe
(or actually, universes). I wrote a small [node][10] script using [x-ray][11] to
get the list of names and matching urls and saved it on my disk.

```javascript
import xray from 'x-ray';
let x = xray();

const targetUrl = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Marvel_Comics_superheroes';
const selector = '#mw-pages .mw-category-group li a@href';

x(targetUrl, selector)((urlList) => {
  // urlList is an array of all `href` values
});
```

Then my journey of extracting data from the Wikipedia begun.

As I said, I love APIs. And the Wikipedia being the huge project that it is,
I was sure that they had an API to get clean data from each page. They do have
an API for sure, but it only returns the raw dump of the page, including a mix
of HTML and custom Wikipedia markup. This is not formatted at all, so was of no
use to me.

![Wikipedia API example][12]

Example taken from [here][13]

## DBPedia

I kept searching and found the [DBPedia][14], which is an unofficial project of
creating an API of structured data on top of the original API. The people in
this project did an [Herculean][15] job of converting the raw markup of my
previous example into nice looking JSON responses.

```json
{
  "abstract": [
    {
      "lang": "en",
      "value": "Hercules is a fictional superhero appearing in [因"
    }
  ],
  "aliases": [
   {
     "lang": "en",
     "value": "The Prince of Power, The Lion of Olympus, Harry Cleese, Victor Tegler"
   }
  ]
}
```
Taken from [here][16].json)

Unfortunately, the DBPedia is not dynamic, and all the data returned by the API
is frozen in time. Frozen on August 2015 to be exact. It means that all recent
development in the Marvel universe where no taken into account. And worse than
that, some really popular characters did not even had any data attached to them.

## Infoboxes

That's about that time that I realized that the only information that
I actually needed was the one displayed in the infobox. The infobox is this
little white box on the right side of any Wikipedia page that displays an
overview of the most important facts of the page. In my case it was the name of
the character, its potential aliases, powers, known teams and authors.

![Infobox example][17]

I did not really care about the rest of the page. What I had in mind for my demo
would be a simple way to search through all characters and filter them based on
exactly those criteria (power, teams, authors) and being able to find them with
any of their aliases. So I needed a way to extract content from the infobox.

Fortunately, I started this project in node. And node comes with npm, where there
is a module for anything. I quickly found [wiki-infobox][18] that let me extract
a _mostly_ structured representation of the data in the infobox, by just feeding
it the name of the page.

```javascript
import infobox from 'wiki-infobox';

infobox('Hulk_(comics)', 'en', (err, data) => {
 // {
 //   "character_name": {
 //     "type": "text",
 //     "value": "The Incredible Hulk"
 //   },
 //   "aliases": [
 //     {
 //       "type": "text",
 //         "value": "<br>Green Scar<br>World-Breaker<br>Jade Giant"
 //     },
 //     [因
 //   ],
 //   [因
 // }
});
```

I say _mostly_ because the module tries its best to manually parse the raw dump
I showed earlier. And it did that using regexp and trying to handle all possible
edge cases. Overall it worked quite well, but I still had to clean the output to
have something that I could work with. My respect for the team behind DBPedia
grew even more at that time, because extracting formatted data from the initial
dump is clearly not an easy task.

Using both DBPedia and the data I got from my infoboxes, I started to have an
interesting dataset. One thing that was missing were popularity metrics.
I wanted my heroes to be displayed by order of popularity. If I start typing
_iron_, I want [Iron Man][19] to be displayed first, not the unknown [Iron
Monger][20] character.

## Wikidata

In order to get this information, I tried the [Wikidata API][21]. This API gave
me a lot of metadata information about each Wikipedia page. But that's it, only
metadata. Data about the data. Like the name of each page in each language or
the other names that redirect to the same page. This wasn't exactly what I was
looking for, but let me grab a nice list of aliases for my characters. Thanks to
that data, I could now find [Spider-Man][22] with [Peter Parker][23],
[Spidey][24] or [Webhead][25].

Of course, there's an npm module to do that easily as well: [wikidata-sdk][26].

## Page views

The more I searched for Wikipedia-related APIs, the more I found weird projects.
The last one I used is [stats.grok.se][27], which is the personal project of
a core contributor that exposes as an API, the pageview count of each Wikipedia
article on the past 90 days. This could give me the popularity ranking I was
looking for. The page for [Iron Man][28] was visited way more often than the one
for [Iron Monger][29], so I could use that data to rank them.

![Infobox example][30]

Unfortunately, the stats are only valid up to December 2015. After that, the
endpoints were just returning empty results. But what I also discovered is that
those results were Netflix-biased. I mean that at the time I did the crawling,
Netflix just released its [Jessica Jones][31] show, so [Jessica Jones][32] and
all the other characters from the show ([Purple Man][33] or [Luke Cage][34]) had
the more important number of pageviewsr. While the show is great, Jessica Jones
is in no way a more popular character than, say, Spider-Man, Iron Man or Captain
America in the comics.

My dataset was starting to look promising but there was one information that
I still did not manage to get. Believe me or not, but from all the APIs I tried,
absolutely none of them were able to give me the url of the image used to
display the character. I absolutely needed this image to build a demo that
looked nice, so I coded another small `x-ray` script to go scrap every Wikipedia
HTML page and extract the image url. Sometimes the best solution is the more
obvious one.

## Marvel API

It took me a few days to do everything I mentioned above. Just to be sure, I had
a new look at the Marvel developer portal and I discovered that they fixed it.
So I registered for an API key and started exploring their API to see what
I could extract from it.

First thing to know is that the Marvel API is tedious to use. I had countless
timeouts, infinite redirect loops, empty results, errors and other things that
made the whole experience unpleasant. But in the end it was all worth it because
of the quality of the data you can extract from the API.

![Daredevil example][35]

First of all, they do provide url to an avatar image of each hero. And not just
any avatar image, one that is correctly cropped and with all background noise
removed. It also gives you an _in-universe_ description of each character. So
now I could display that Daredevil was the secret identity of Matt Murdock,
whose father was a boxer. As opposed to simply saying that "Daredevil is
a fictional character from the Marvel universe", which is not very relevant. And
finally the API gave me the popularity ranking I was looking for. For each
character I have the count of comics, stories and events they were involved in.

```json
{
  "name": "Daredevil",
  "description": "Abandoned by his mother, Matt Murdock was raised [因",
  "thumbnail": "http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/6/90/537ba6d49472b/standard_xlarge.jpg"
  "comicCount": 827,
  "eventCount": 11,
  "serieCount": 163,
  "storyCount": 1326
}
```
All data I could get from the Marvel API was of much better quality than
anything I could have had from the Wikipedia. Still, each character only had
a few bits of information, so I merged results with my previous Wikipedia
scraping, using fallbacks to always use the best possible value.

## Marvel website

One last drawback of the Marvel API is that their website does not even use it.
You can find on the official Marvel website pages for [each character][36] that
display more information about them that what you could find in the API (things
like their weight or height). The designers at Marvel did an incredible job at
defining a main page color for each character. It means that the [Hulk][37] page
will have a green tint, while it will be purple for [Hawkeye][38] and red for
[Daredevil][39].

![Color tint example][40]

They also defined custom background images for major characters. All character
pages have several panels of comics in the background, but for major characters,
all panels are actually taken from real adventures of that character.

![Background example][41]

Through tedious scraping and parsing of CSS and JavaScript, I managed to extract
this information for each character, and could use it to improve the UI.

## Tips & tricks

I will give more details about how I build the UI in another post, and don't
worry it will be way easier than getting the data. Before closing this post I'd
like to share a few tips I learned from this whole process of getting data out
of APIs and websites.

First of all, you should create isolated and repeatable scripts. In my case my
data was coming from various sources, so I created a script per source. That way
I could just run the DBPedia script again and update only the data coming from
the DBPedia.

Crawling always comes in two steps. First you have to get the data from the
website or API, then you have to extract and format it the way you want.

Downloading data from an endpoint is as easy as saving the distant url on disk,
but this can take a long time because you have to pay the price of the whole
download process. On the other end, once you have the file on disk, parsing it
to format its content the way you want it is really fast, but chances are that
you'll have to rewrite your script dozens of times until you got all the edge
cases right.

My advice is to always create two different scripts. The first one will blindly
download all the urls and save the output on disk, without doing any formatting
on it. The second one will read the local version and extract the data. Doing
so, you only pay the price of the download once, and can then quickly iterate on
the extraction part.

I would not commit the temporary files into a git repository, but only the
output formatted files. Whatever the format in which you store the output file,
I would make sure that the way it is saved is consistent across extractions, so
you can easily do a diff between two versions of the file. For JSON, this means
ordering your keys alphabetically.

Finally, when dealing with external sources, especially the Wikipedia, I'd be
extremely careful on the inputs. You're basically handling data that has been
written by somebody else. Chances are that they forgot to close a tag, or that
the data will not be correctly formed one way or another. Add scripts to fix the
data for you, and add tests to those scripts so you're sure that when fixing one
issue you're not creating a new one. I have more than 300 tests for this
example. It's a lot, but it's needed.

## Conclusion

This was a really cool project to do. You can see the [demo online][42], or
browse through [the code][43]. Everything is in it, from the import scripts to
the final UI, even including the JSON data files.
