I'm currently forced to develop on Windows. And it hurts. I feel like
a clockmaker forced to work with gloves and blindfolded. I keep hitting strange
and weird Windows limitations that are real productivity killers.

The most recent was not being able to delete a folder because its filename was
too long. Wait, what ? As soon as you start using `npm` and download a bit of
modules, you'll most certainly end up with a `node_modules` folder that's too
long for Windows to handle.

But `npm` is clever, and it can circumvent this limitation. So, whenever you
want to delete a `node_modules` folder and Windows won't let you do it, use
`npm`. Update your `package.json` to remove every element in `dependencies` and
`devDependencies` and run `npm prune`. This will empty your `node_modules`
folder.

You're welcome.
