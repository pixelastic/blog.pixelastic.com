I just ran into a strange behavior on Safari 3 (Win). I'm not quite sure what
caused this problem, but I tracked it down to one CSS rule.

The thing was that I had an input field that moved whenever I tried to focus
it. It jump 3 pixels up whenever I gave him focus. I had never seen that
before.

I finally managed to track it down to the padding:2px 0px 5px 0px;
declaration. I exploded it in four (-top, -right, -bottom and -left) and it
seemed that it was the padding-bottom:0px that cause the bug.

I finally rewrote my css (in three lines instead of one) and moved to other
things.

I post it here as a reminder, and hope it could help someone.
