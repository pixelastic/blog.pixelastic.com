Today, the [jquery 1.4](http://jquery14.com/day-01/jquery-14) version was
released, and today is the day where I start to learn extJs (don't ask me
why).

[EXTJs](http://www.extjs.com/) seems to be promising, it seems really easy to
make powerful and professional-looking interfaces for handling data with it.

When learning Coldfusion I was often horrified by the [really poor html
example code](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/WSc3ff6d0ea77
859461172e0811cbec22c24-79f9.html) shipped with the Coldfusion example :
<font>, <span align="left">, multiple nested tables.

With EXTJs, it seems to be the same, the [basic page
setup](http://www.extjs.com/learn/Tutorial:Basic_Page_Setup) tell me not to
put a Doctype to my page to "avoid IE problems", as well as putting my
javascript in the head of the page...

That is simply horrible advices. I hope the rest of the framewok is not of the
same kind or learning it will be painful.



One thing that is quite frustrating with their documentation is that it is
absolutly not up to date. It is refering to 1.0 or 2.0 version even if the
current one is 3.0.

I resort to reading the "Learning EXTJs" book (if you know how to properly use
google, you should find a full PDF online). It told me a lot of things about
the approach of the framework, I sincerely recommend that you read it if you
want to learn ExtJs. Too bad the book was released before the 3.0 version, but
by refering to the API whenever you need to use a new class, you should be ok
