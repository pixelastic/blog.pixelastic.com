This post will be the first of what I hope will be a long serie of posts. I'll
blog about some of the little tricks I've learn in the past years that make me
go faster on my daily job.

I'll start with something I can no longer work without : my global hotkeys.

The concept is pretty simple, I've binded some keys combinations to launch
specific applications or directories. It might not seem very important, but it
does make you gain a tremendous amount of time for those apps you launch
pretty often like browser, IDE, or project directory.

I used to work on Windows, and I then used a little script named
[AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) to bind my keys. The script even
comes packaged with its own language if you ever want to script complicated
stuff.

I'm now working under Ubuntu, and the global hotkeys can be defined directly
from the System Settings (in 11.10 it's `System Settings > Keyboard >
Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts`)

## Opening apps

I choose a key combination hard enough to type so I won't type it by mistake,
but easy enough to remember that I could type it whenever I want.

For example, I binded all the app I use the most to a `Ctrl+Win+{Letter}`
combination. `Ctrl+Win+C` opens Chromium, `Ctrl+Win+F` opens Firefox,
`Ctrl+Win+T` opens Trillian, etc.

## Opening folders

I used a close combination for opening directories : `Ctrl+Win+Alt+{Letter}`.
Those three keys are side by side on most keyboards so pressing them is easy.

This time I used the letter `H` for my home folder, `D` for the Dropbox
folder, `W` for `/var/www`, etc, etc.

I've tweaked my keyboard in a few other ways, but this will be the subject of
another post. Hope this one gave you some ideas.
