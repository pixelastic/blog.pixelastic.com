For one of the tests I'm currently writing, I needed to assert that my method
was correctly returning an error if the connection to the database was
impossible.

I couldn't find an easy way to change datasource credentials once the app was
initiated, so I decided to manually update the `ConnectionManager` inner
values.

Here's how I did it :


```php
// Getting the datasource cache in the ConnectionManager object
$connectionManagerInstance = ConnectionManager::getInstance();
$databaseConfig = &$connectionManagerInstance->_dataSources;

// Saving the initial setting for reverting it later
$_defaultConfig = $databaseConfig['default'];

// Changing the password so the credentials will fail
$databaseConfig['default']->config['password'].= 'pass';

// Getting the updated datasource
$connect = ConnectionManager::getDataSource('default');

// Error handling when connection unavailable
[...]

// And reverting the settings back
$databaseConfig['default'] = $_defaultConfig;
```


This proved really useful when testing to simulate a database server error.
