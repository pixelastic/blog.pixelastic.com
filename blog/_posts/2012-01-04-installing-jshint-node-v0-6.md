Yesterday, I've tried to install nodejs and the jshint package to add
automatic jshint parsing to my vim.

Well, it wasn't so simple due to a bug in the npm version shipped with node.

Here are the complete commands to run to make it work, in case I had to do it
again :


```sh
# Download and extract node
cd ~/local/src
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.6.6/node-v0.6.6.tar.gz
tar xvzf node-v0.6.6.tar.gz
rm node-v0.6.6.tar.gz
# Compile and install
cd node-v0.6.6
./configure
make
sudo make install
# Update npm
sudo npm install npm@alpha -g
# (Optional) Clear npm cache
npm cache clean jshint
# Install jshint
sudo npm install jshint -g
```
