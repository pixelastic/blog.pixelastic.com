I just uploaded the new version of the website. The old one was severely
needing a fresh new look, so here it is.

As I want to showcase my skills as a web developer I didn't want a website
with a too awesome design, so I decided to do it all by myself. I'm quite
happy with the result.

The "Work" page is still in progress, images from the old site aren't yet
available and I haven't yet tested it with IE.

I've added a comment section (a feature that was lacking from the previous
site). I plan to translate the site in French to have something fully
bilingual, but that too is a work in progress.

If you ever spot a bug, just drop a comment, I'm hunting them right now.
