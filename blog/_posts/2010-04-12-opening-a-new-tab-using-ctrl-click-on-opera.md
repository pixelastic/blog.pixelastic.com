One thing that bugs me everytime I use Opera are the weird keyboard shortcuts.
You open link in a new tab by using the middle mouse button (classic) or
Shift+click (less classic, we are accustomed to use the Ctrl+Click,
Shift+Click being used to open in a new window).


Today it was bugging me one too many times, so I decided to use the power of
AutoHotKey to help fix this.

Here is the little snippet I added to my default AutoHotKey script :


```ahk
;        Open page in new tab in Opera using Ctrl + Click
#ifWinActive, ahk_class OpWindow
^LButton::Send +{LButton}
#IfWinActive
```

It basically catch every Shift+Click in Opera and return a Ctrl+Click instead,
allowing me to finally open tabs the way I'm used to.
