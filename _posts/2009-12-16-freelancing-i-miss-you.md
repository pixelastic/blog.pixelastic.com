<p>Well, it's been one month and a half now that I've put my freelance activites on hold. I'm in contract with a big company to develop an internal application.</p>
<p>The purpose of the application is really interesting, the guy I'm working with is too, but the language I have to use as well as the all-administrative thing of big companies like that is... well... let's just say I LOVE being a freelancer PHP developper.</p>
<p>One more month and a half and it will be over. I allready have learn a lot about metadatas in general and particularly Exif, Iptc and XMP. I've also learned a little about Coldfusion. Enough to know that I won't work with that language again, unless I'm forced too.</p>
<p>In the remaining week, I'll also learn EXTJs, and this part seems promising. I guess leaving jQuery and its easy syntax will be hard at first, but all the data handling of EXTJs seems really powerful.</p>
<p>Anyway, when that contract will be over, I'll be back to Caracole and I have so many ideas of features and whole websites that I want to create...</p>
<p>I would like to make the admin panel of Caracole the one thing an administrator would have to check to see if everything is going well on its website. I allready have an extended <code>PHPInfo() </code>highlighting possible misconfiguration but I want to push that further by integrating Google Analytics, checking the Gmail inbox associated as well as integrating the PHPSec library.</p>
<p>In the future I also plan on creating a photography website for Street Art and graffitis, with gelocalisation, metadatas saving of the author and place, possibility to upload photo directly from a mobile phone, etc</p>
<p>The old ideas about my own personal website, a quizz website, or one for rating driver's ed are still in my mind. Wait and see.</p>
