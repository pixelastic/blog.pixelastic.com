Call me old fashioned but I do not really like the "always connected" motto
that the industry is following right now. I like to have physical music and
video files on my hard drive, so I can access them anywhere, anytime, without
relying on me being connected to a network.

And yes, I get the irony of talking about _physical _files_._

Anyway, I now download movies directly from [Youtube](http://youtube.com/),
[Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/), [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/) and
consorts, copy them to my smartphone, and watch them in the train, waiting
queues or bed.

To achieve that, here are the command-line tools I'm using. First is [youtube-
dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl), and as its name does not imply at all,
it can download from more than Youtube. The second one is
[vimeo_downloader](https://github.com/bf4/vimeo_downloader) which is
specialised in downloading from Vimeo. And the last one is the more generic
[get_flash_videos](http://code.google.com/p/get-flash-videos/) that can
download from a variety of smaller websites.

All those scripts accepts the video url as parameter.

Happy scripting and happy viewing !
